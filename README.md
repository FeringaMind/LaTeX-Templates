# Job Applications

LaTeX templates for a US resume and cover letter. 

Both ```cover_letter.tex``` and ```resume.tex``` are set up and layed out in such a way that ATS systems are able to read them out as best as possible.

## application.tex

Both ```cover_letter.tex``` and ```resume.tex``` rely on the ```application.tex``` file to be in their parent directory. It provides some definitions and commands.

## cover_letter.tex

A template for a one-page cover letter with a letter head, body and footer. 

## resume.tex

A template for a one-page resume with a summary, experience, education and skills section. 

# (Bachelor) Thesis

Provides a template for a (bachelor) thesis paper. 

I created this template for my bachelor thesis paper in Germany, which is why it is set up for the A4 paper format. However, this can easily be changed in the ```paper.tex``` file.
